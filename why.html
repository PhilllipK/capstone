   <h1>How to colonize</h1>
 
 
   <p>There are multiple possible ways to colonize Venus. One is more temporary while the other is more contemporary. The more temporary colony involves building cities high in Venus's atmosphere. This would allow humans to safley live in venus provided they are wearing protective gear. Additionally, due to the relativly mild temperatures crops and high co2 content crops could be grown on these flying cities. A more permanent colony could involve freezing venus's atmosphere by reflecting the sun's rays away from the planet via mirrors. This would cause the atmosphere to turn to ice which could be removed. After the mirrors are removed a new atmosphere could replace the old one to make it suitable for humans. After wards life could thrive on Venus first in the form of plants.</p>
